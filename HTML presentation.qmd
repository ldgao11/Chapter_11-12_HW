## Introduction of Obesity

Overweight is a condition of excessive fat deposits.

**Obesity** is a chronic complex disease defined by excessive fat deposits that can impair health. Obesity can lead to increased risk of type 2 diabetes and heart disease, it can affect bone health and reproduction, it increases the risk of certain cancers. Obesity influences the quality of living, such as sleeping or moving.

## Diagnosis of Obesity

The diagnosis of overweight and obesity is made by measuring people’s weight and height and by calculating the body mass index (BMI): weight (kg)/height² (m²). The body mass index is a surrogate marker of fatness and additional measurements, such as the waist circumference, can help the diagnosis of obesity.

The BMI categories for defining obesity vary by age and gender in infants, children and adolescents.

## Adults

For adults, WHO defines overweight and obesity as follows:

-   overweight is a BMI greater than or equal to 25; and
-   obesity is a BMI greater than or equal to 30.

## Adults

| **BMI**      | **Classification**                 |
|:-------------|:-----------------------------------|
| 18.5 to 24.9 | Normal, or healthy, weight         |
| 25 to 29.9   | Overweight                         |
| 30+          | Obesity (including severe obesity) |
| 40+          | Severe obesity                     |
|              |                                    |

For children, age needs to be considered when defining overweight and obesity.

## Children under 5 years of age

-   overweight is weight-for-height greater than 2 standard deviations above WHO Child Growth Standards median; and
-   obesity is weight-for-height greater than 3 standard deviations above the WHO Child Growth Standards median.

## Children aged between 5–19 years

-   overweight is BMI-for-age greater than 1 standard deviation above the WHO Growth Reference median; and

-   obesity is greater than 2 standard deviations above the WHO Growth Reference median.
